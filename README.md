### About

Thoughtporn - Combination of /r/earthporn and /r/showerthoughts.  

/r/earthporn consists of some really epic masterpiece photographs of places in/seen from Earth.  
/r/showerthoughts, A subreddit for you to share all those thoughts, ideas, or philosophical questions that race through your head when in the shower.   

Combining the thoughts from /r/showerthoughts in those beautiful pictures of /r/earthporn makes it look kind of philosophical and legit. Most of the social media pages use this trick to become a hit. A witty philosophical quote and a nice background; One must believe whatever is seen there!

### Technical Details

This script is a shitty bash script to do the task mentioned above. It relies on `curl` and `imagemagick`. Install those if you don't have them in your system.  
Also this script opens the combined image in `firefox` browser, if you do not have it then install it or find the image in `/tmp` folder named `final_tp.png`. Open it with image viewer of your choice.

#### Usage
Just run it as you run a normal bash script:  
`./thoughtporn.sh`  

#### Note

I do not own any pictures or the thoughts. Credits to respective authors. You can view link to the reddit profile of the image uploader/author on the footer of the image.All credits to him/her.
